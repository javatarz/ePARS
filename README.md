# ePARS
ePARS _(read: eh-pa-rs)_ is short for EMR Price and Availability Recommendation Service.

## Why use ePARS?
AWS' EMR supports using spot instances to optimise your spark workload for certain cluster configurations. When the spot prices or interruption adivsory for these instances change, the best instances for your workload might also change. This service runs a recommendation engine to maximise stability and minimise cost.
